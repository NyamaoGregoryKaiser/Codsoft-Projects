This is a highly simplified example.  A real-world project would require significantly more code for robust error handling, authentication, authorization, database interaction (using a real database like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB),  frontend development, comprehensive testing, and CI/CD pipeline integration. Remember to install the necessary libraries (like cpprestsdk and spdlog) using your package manager (e.g., vcpkg, apt, brew).  This provides a solid foundation upon which you can build a more complete system.  Remember to replace placeholder comments with actual implementations.  You'll also need to add extensive testing and a frontend. This response gives you a starting point.  Consider using a framework like FastAPI (Python) or similar for a more streamlined development experience.
