...(Continue with routes, models, migrations, seed data, testing, frontend (React),  CI/CD setup using tools like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI, authentication and authorization (e.g., JWT), caching with Redis, and comprehensive documentation).


This is a skeletal structure. Building a full-fledged system like this is a substantial undertaking, requiring many more files and a considerable amount of code.  You will need to implement robust error handling, thorough testing, and detailed documentation to meet the enterprise-grade requirements. Remember to manage environment variables securely using a dedicated secrets management system in a production environment.  This example omits many crucial security considerations, which you **must** address in a production application.
