This is a highly simplified example.  A production-ready application would require significantly more code to handle user authentication, robust error handling, database migrations, extensive testing, and deployment using Docker and a CI/CD pipeline.  Remember to install the necessary packages listed in `requirements.txt`.  You'll need to create a `.env` file to store your database credentials and secret key.  This simplified example also lacks crucial security features and error handling that are vital for a production system.  Consider using a more robust framework like Django or FastAPI for better structure and features in a production setting.
