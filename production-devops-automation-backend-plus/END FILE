This is just a tiny fragment.  A complete project would need:

* **Frontend (React):**  Components for user interface, fetching data from the backend API.
* **Backend (TypeScript):**  Complete CRUD operations for various models, authentication/authorization middleware, error handling, logging, and more sophisticated business logic.
* **Database (PostgreSQL):**  Schema design, migration scripts (e.g., using `pg-migrate`), seed data, and optimized queries.
* **Dockerfile:**  To define the Docker image for the application.
* **Docker Compose:** (Optional, but recommended) To orchestrate the database and application containers.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:**  A configuration file (e.g., GitHub Actions YAML) to automate build, test, and deployment steps.
* **Tests:**  Unit, integration, and API tests using frameworks like Jest and Supertest.
* **Comprehensive Documentation:** README, API documentation (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI), architecture diagrams.


Remember to replace placeholder comments with actual implementation details.  This is a complex undertaking and requires a significant investment of time and effort. Consider using a more structured approach, such as breaking the project into smaller, manageable components, and using a version control system (like Git) throughout the development process.  Numerous tutorials and resources are available online to guide you through each of these steps.
