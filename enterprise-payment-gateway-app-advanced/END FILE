This is a highly simplified illustration.  A production-ready system needs:

* **Secure Payment Gateway Integration:**  Use established APIs (Stripe, PayPal, etc.) for secure transaction processing.  **Never** handle sensitive card details directly in your application.
* **Robust Error Handling:**  Implement comprehensive error handling and logging to gracefully handle failures and provide informative error messages.
* **Authentication and Authorization:** Secure user authentication (e.g., using JWT) and authorization to control access to sensitive resources.
* **Testing:** Extensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests are crucial.
* **Scalability:** Design the system to handle a large number of concurrent users and transactions.
* **Security:**  Implement security best practices to protect against various threats (SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.).
* **Compliance:** Ensure compliance with relevant payment processing regulations (PCI DSS, etc.).


Remember to replace placeholder comments and values with your actual implementation details.  This skeleton provides a starting point; building a full-fledged payment processing system is a substantial undertaking.  Consider using frameworks like NestJS (Node.js) or similar for better structure and maintainability.
