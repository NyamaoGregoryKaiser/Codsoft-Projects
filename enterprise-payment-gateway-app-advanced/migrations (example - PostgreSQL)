You'd need migration files (e.g., using `pg-migrate`) to manage database schema changes.  Example SQL:

```sql
-- migration-name: create_payments_table
CREATE TABLE payments (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
  card_details TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
