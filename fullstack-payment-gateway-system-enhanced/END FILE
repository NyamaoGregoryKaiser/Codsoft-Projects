This is a highly simplified example.  A production-ready system would require:

* **Robust Authentication and Authorization:**  Implement secure authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT) and granular authorization to control access to different system features.
* **Payment Gateway Integration:** Integrate with a secure payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle sensitive payment data.  **Never process credit card information directly on your server.**
* **Transaction Management:** Implement proper transaction management to ensure data consistency in the database.
* **Error Handling and Logging:** Implement comprehensive error handling and logging to track issues and facilitate debugging.
* **Security Best Practices:** Follow security best practices (OWASP guidelines) to protect against common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
* **Scalability and Performance:** Design the system for scalability and performance to handle a large volume of transactions.
* **Testing (unit, integration, system):**  Write comprehensive tests to ensure the system's correctness and reliability.
* **CI/CD:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline to automate building, testing, and deploying the application.


This example provides a foundation.  Building a full-scale payment processing system requires significantly more code and expertise in secure software development practices. Remember to consult with security experts and utilize established payment processing libraries and services for any real-world application.
