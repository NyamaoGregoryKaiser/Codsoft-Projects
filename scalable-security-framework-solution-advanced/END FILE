This is a highly simplified example. A production-ready system would require:

* **More robust error handling:**  Handle exceptions gracefully and provide informative error messages.
* **Input validation:** Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
* **Rate limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
* **Database migrations:** Use Alembic or similar tools to manage database schema changes.
* **Comprehensive logging:** Log all relevant events for debugging and security auditing.
* **Production-ready deployment:** Configure a proper production environment using tools like Kubernetes or AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
* **Security best practices:** Securely store secrets, use HTTPS, and regularly update dependencies.
* **Detailed API documentation:** Generate Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for easy API usage.

Remember to replace placeholder values like `your_secret_key` and `your_jwt_secret_key` with securely generated values.  This skeletal example gives you a starting point; building a full-fledged application requires considerably more effort.  Consider using a framework like React or Vue.js for the frontend, and explore more advanced security practices.
