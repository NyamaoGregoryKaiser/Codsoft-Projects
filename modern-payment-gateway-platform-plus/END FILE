This is a highly simplified illustration. A real-world payment processing system would require:


* **Secure Payment Gateway Integration:**  Integration with a reputable payment gateway (Stripe, PayPal, Braintree, etc.) is crucial.  This involves using their APIs securely and handling sensitive data according to PCI DSS standards.
* **Database Design:**  A robust database schema to manage users, payments, transactions, refunds, etc.  Consider using a relational database (PostgreSQL, MySQL) for data integrity.
* **API Design and Implementation:**  RESTful APIs for handling payment requests, confirmations, and other operations.  Consider using a framework like  RESTbed or similar.
* **Frontend Development:**  A user interface for users and administrators to interact with the system.  React, Angular, or Vue.js could be used for frontend development.
* **Security Measures:**  Implementation of robust security measures, including encryption (TLS/SSL), input validation, authentication, and authorization.  Regular security audits are essential.
* **Error Handling and Logging:**  Comprehensive error handling and logging to track issues and debug problems.
* **Testing:**  Extensive unit, integration, and end-to-end testing to ensure the system's reliability and security.


This expanded outline gives a better understanding of the complexity.  To build a full-scale system, you would need to significantly expand on each of these points, using appropriate libraries and frameworks.  Remember to prioritize security above all else when working with financial data.  Consider consulting with security experts and following established best practices for payment processing.
