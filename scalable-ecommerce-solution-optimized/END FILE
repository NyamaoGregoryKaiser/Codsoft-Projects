This is a highly simplified example.  A production-ready system would require:

* **Detailed implementation of all CRUD operations:**  Adding, reading, updating, and deleting products, users, orders, and categories.
* **Authentication and Authorization:** Secure user login, token-based authentication, and role-based access control.
* **Robust error handling:**  Properly handling exceptions and returning informative error messages.
* **Database migrations:**  Managing database schema changes using tools like Prisma Migrate.
* **Testing:**  Comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
* **Frontend development:** Building a user interface using a framework like React, Vue, or Angular.  This would involve significant UI/UX design work.
* **Deployment:** Setting up a production environment, potentially using Docker and Kubernetes.
* **Caching:** Implementing caching strategies to improve performance.
* **Payment gateway integration:** Connecting to a payment processor (Stripe, PayPal, etc.).
* **Shipping integration:**  Integrating with a shipping provider.


This expanded example provides a starting point. Remember to consult relevant documentation for each technology used (Express.js, Prisma, TypeScript, your chosen frontend framework, etc.) to build a complete, production-ready e-commerce solution.  This is a large-scale project requiring significant effort and expertise.
