This is a highly simplified example. A full-scale project would require:

* **Detailed Database Schema:**  Define tables for datasets, users, visualizations, etc., with appropriate data types and relationships.
* **Robust Authentication:** Implement secure user authentication and authorization using JWT or similar.
* **Comprehensive Data Processing:**  Add features to upload, process, and transform data.
* **Visualization Library:** Integrate a charting library like Chart.js, D3.js, Recharts, or a more advanced solution like Plotly.js or Nivo.
* **Extensive Testing:** Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
* **Dockerfile:** Create a Dockerfile for containerizing your application.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up a CI/CD pipeline using tools like GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, or Jenkins.
* **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the application.
* **Caching:** Implement caching to improve performance.

Remember to replace placeholder values with your actual credentials and configurations. This is a starting point, and building a full-fledged application will require substantially more code and effort.  Focus on one component at a time and build iteratively.  Use version control (Git) religiously!
