This is an opportunity to carry out various projects depending on your area of interest.
My area of choice was Artificial Intelligence and I worked on the following projects:
1 Chatbot
2 Tic tac Toe Game
Here I desighned a simple tic tac game and then later implemented the minimax algorithm to help with the logic of making he best optimal move for the ai gamer plaing against a human.My Tic-tac game that plays against human, this games uses Minimax algoriths this is used in decision making and game theory to find the optimal move for a player,
The maximizer tries to get the highest score possible while the minimizer tries to do the opposite and get the lowest score possible.
