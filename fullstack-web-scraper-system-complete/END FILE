This is a highly simplified structure. A full-fledged project would require significantly more code for:

* **Robust error handling:**  Handle network errors, invalid URLs, changes in website structure, and database errors gracefully.
* **Rate limiting:** Implement delays and techniques to avoid overwhelming target websites.
* **Authentication and Authorization:** Secure your API with JWTs or other methods.
* **Comprehensive testing:** Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests are crucial.
* **Deployment:**  Configure a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using Github Actions, Gitlab CI, or Jenkins).
* **Caching:** Use Redis or Memcached to speed up repeated scrapes.
* **Logging and monitoring:** Implement logging to track errors and performance.  Use tools like Sentry or Datadog for monitoring.


Remember to replace placeholders and expand on these basic components to create a complete, production-ready application.  This outline provides a strong starting point for building your web scraping system.  You will need considerable coding experience to fill in the gaps and ensure robust functionality.
