This is a highly simplified example.  A real-world e-commerce application would require:

* **Extensive frontend development (React, Vue, Angular, etc.):**  Handling user interface, shopping cart, payment integration, etc.
* **Robust authentication and authorization:** Secure user accounts and protect sensitive data.
* **Payment gateway integration:**  Connect to services like Stripe or PayPal.
* **Order management:**  Track orders, manage inventory, and handle shipping.
* **User accounts and profiles:**  Allow users to manage their information.
* **Search and filtering:**  Enable users to easily find products.
* **Image uploading and storage:** Handle product images.
* **Detailed error handling and logging:**  Provide informative error messages and track application behavior.
* **Comprehensive testing:**  Ensure the system is reliable and performs as expected.


This response provides a starting point.  Building a full e-commerce system requires substantial development effort and expertise.  Consider exploring frameworks like Django or more advanced Flask patterns for larger projects. Remember to prioritize security and scalability from the beginning.
