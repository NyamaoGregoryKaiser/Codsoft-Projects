This is a highly simplified example.  A real-world payment processing system would require:

* **Secure communication:** HTTPS, encryption of sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
* **Payment gateway integration:**  Stripe, PayPal, etc.  These handle the actual transaction processing and security.
* **Robust error handling:**  Graceful handling of failed transactions, network errors, etc.
* **Fraud prevention:** Mechanisms to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions.
* **Scalability:**  Ability to handle a large volume of transactions.
* **Compliance:** Adherence to regulations like PCI DSS.


This skeletal example provides a starting point.  Remember to expand upon this with the necessary security, scalability, and compliance measures before deploying anything to production.  Consider using a framework like Django or FastAPI for a more structured and scalable application.  Remember that building a production-ready system like this requires significant effort and expertise, and is beyond the scope of a single code example.
