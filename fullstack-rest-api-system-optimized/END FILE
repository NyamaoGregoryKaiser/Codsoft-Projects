This is a highly simplified example. A full-scale project would require:

* **More robust authentication:** JWT, OAuth 2.0
* **Detailed error handling:**  Custom exception classes, proper HTTP status codes
* **Comprehensive database schema:**  Relationships between tables, data validation
* **Extensive testing:**  Mocking, parameterized tests, code coverage analysis
* **Deployment scripts:**  For deploying to a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure)
* **Frontend framework:**  React, Vue, Angular (more complex than the example)
* **Caching layer:**  Redis, Memcached
* **Rate limiting:**  Using a library like Flask-Limiter
* **Logging and monitoring:**  Using tools like ELK stack or similar.


Remember to replace placeholders like  `os.getenv('DATABASE_URL')` and `os.getenv('SECRET_KEY')` with actual environment variables.  This expanded outline provides a more realistic starting point for building a comprehensive API system.  You would need to fill in many missing components and significantly increase the codebase to reach the 2000+ line goal.
