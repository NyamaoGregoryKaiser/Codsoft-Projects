**(Database Schema - PostgreSQL)**

You'll need to create a `data` table in your PostgreSQL database.  The schema depends on your data.  Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE data (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    date DATE NOT NULL,
    value NUMERIC NOT NULL
);
```

**(Migrations)**  You would use a migration system (like `pg-migrate`) to manage database schema changes.

**(Dockerfile)**

A basic `Dockerfile` for the backend:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3001

CMD [ "node", "index.js" ]
```

This is a highly simplified example.  A production-ready system requires significantly more code, robust error handling, comprehensive testing, security measures (input validation, authentication, authorization, protection against SQL injection), and a well-defined CI/CD pipeline.  Remember to adapt and expand upon these snippets to build your full application.  Consider using a framework like Next.js or Remix for the frontend for improved performance and features.  For the backend, explore options like NestJS or Fastify for better structure.  Remember to configure environment variables securely.  Don't hardcode sensitive information like database credentials directly in your code.
