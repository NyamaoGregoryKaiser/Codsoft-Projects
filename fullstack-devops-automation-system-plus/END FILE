This is a highly simplified example.  A production-ready system would require:

* **Detailed implementation:**  The `server.ts` and route files need extensive coding to handle all features (CRUD operations, authentication, authorization, error handling, etc.).
* **Robust testing:**  Comprehensive unit, integration, and API tests are vital.
* **CI/CD pipeline:**  Configure a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins) to automate building, testing, and deployment.
* **Deployment strategy:**  Choose a deployment strategy (e.g., Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, serverless functions).
* **Security considerations:**  Implement security best practices to protect against vulnerabilities.
* **Scalability:**  Design the application to handle increased traffic and data volume.
* **Monitoring and logging:** Integrate logging and monitoring tools for observability.


This skeletal structure provides a starting point.  Remember to consult relevant documentation for each technology used (Express, Prisma, PostgreSQL, your chosen CI/CD system, etc.) to complete the implementation.  This is a significant undertaking requiring substantial coding effort.
