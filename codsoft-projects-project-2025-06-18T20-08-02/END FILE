This is a very basic example.  A full-scale project would require:

* **Detailed API Endpoints:**  Complete CRUD operations for users, potentially other resources.
* **Database Migrations:**  Using tools like Flyway or Liquibase to manage database schema changes.
* **JWT Integration:** Securely handle authentication with JSON Web Tokens.
* **Frontend Implementation:**  A React, Angular, or Vue.js frontend would be necessary to interact with the backend API.
* **Comprehensive Testing:** Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure quality.
* **Dockerfile and Kubernetes/Docker Compose:**  For containerization and deployment.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:**  Using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.
* **Error Handling and Logging:** Robust mechanisms to handle exceptions and log events.
* **Caching:** Improve performance using a caching layer (e.g., Redis).
* **Rate Limiting:** Prevent abuse of the API.


Remember to replace placeholder comments and adapt this example to your specific needs.  Building a full-scale system is a substantial undertaking.  This is just a starting point to get you going.  Consider using Spring Boot's features to simplify development.
