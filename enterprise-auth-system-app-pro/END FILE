This is a highly simplified example.  A full-scale project would require significantly more code to handle error handling, input validation, robust testing,  more sophisticated database interactions,  and a comprehensive frontend.  Remember to install the necessary dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.  You'll also need to set up PostgreSQL and configure your database connection string correctly.  Adding Docker and CI/CD would require further configuration (e.g., using Dockerfiles, Docker Compose, and a CI/CD platform like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI).  This skeletal structure provides a foundation; building a full, production-ready system is a substantial undertaking.
