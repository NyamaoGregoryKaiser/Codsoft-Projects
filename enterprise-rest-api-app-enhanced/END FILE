This is a highly simplified example. A full-scale project would require:

* **A robust HTTP server library:**  Consider using libraries like Drogon, Pistache, or a wrapper around a more established library like Boost.Beast.
* **A database library:**  Choose a library appropriate for your database (e.g., libpq for PostgreSQL, MySQL Connector/C++).
* **A comprehensive testing framework:**  Google Test or Catch2 are popular choices for C++.
* **Frontend framework:** React, Angular, Vue.js etc.
* **Authentication and Authorization:**  Implement using JWTs or OAuth 2.0.
* **CI/CD pipeline:**  Use GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins.

Remember to replace placeholders like `<other dependencies>` with actual package names for your specific needs and adapt the code to your chosen technologies. Building a full-scale system like this is a significant undertaking, and this response only provides a basic framework to get started.  Break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks, and incrementally add features and testing.  Consider using version control (Git) throughout the development process.
