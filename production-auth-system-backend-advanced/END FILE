This is a highly simplified example.  A production-ready system would require:

* **Robust error handling:**  Comprehensive error handling throughout the codebase.
* **Password hashing:**  Use a strong, one-way hashing algorithm (like bcrypt or Argon2) to store passwords securely.  Never store passwords in plain text.
* **Input validation:**  Thoroughly validate all user inputs to prevent vulnerabilities like SQL injection.
* **Authentication and authorization:** Implement proper mechanisms for verifying user identity and controlling access to resources.  Consider using JWTs (JSON Web Tokens).
* **Session management:**  Manage user sessions securely.
* **A real web framework:**  Use a C++ web framework (like Drogon, Pistache, or Crow) to handle HTTP requests.
* **Frontend development:**  Build a full frontend using a JavaScript framework (React, Vue, Angular) to interact with the backend API.
* **Database migrations:** Use a migration system to manage database schema changes.
* **Testing:** Implement comprehensive unit, integration, and API tests.
* **Deployment:** Set up a production-ready deployment pipeline using Docker and CI/CD tools.


This expanded skeleton provides a more realistic starting point. Remember to replace placeholder comments with actual code and incorporate security best practices throughout your development process.  The complete project would be significantly larger and require a team effort.
