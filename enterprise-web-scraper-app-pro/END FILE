This is a highly simplified example. A production-ready system needs:

* **Robust error handling:**  Handle network errors, database errors, parsing errors, etc., gracefully.
* **Multithreading/asynchronous operations:**  Improve performance by fetching and processing multiple pages concurrently.
* **Proper HTML parsing library:**  Use a well-tested HTML parsing library to handle various HTML structures reliably.
* **Rate limiting:** Respect the website's robots.txt and implement rate limiting to avoid being blocked.
* **Authentication and Authorization:** Secure your API endpoints.
* **Frontend:** A fully functional frontend (React, Angular, Vue.js) to display scraped data.
* **Testing:** Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
* **Deployment:**  Docker, Kubernetes, or other deployment strategies.
* **Logging and monitoring:** Track application performance and errors.
* **Database design:** A well-structured database schema.


Remember to install necessary libraries: libcurl, libpqxx, and a suitable build system (CMake is shown here).  This example provides a starting point; building a full-scale system requires significantly more effort and code.  Consider using a framework like  Boost.Asio for asynchronous networking and a more structured approach to database interactions to improve performance and scalability. Remember to always respect website terms of service and robots.txt files when scraping.
