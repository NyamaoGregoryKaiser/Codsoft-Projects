...(This would continue with controllers, services, repositories, entities, database schema (e.g., using Liquibase or Flyway), React frontend code (components for charts, dashboards, data input forms), testing code, Dockerfile, CI/CD pipeline configuration (e.g., using Jenkins or GitLab CI), and extensive documentation.)...


This is a *highly* simplified starting point. A real-world project would require considerably more code to handle aspects like:

* **Robust Data Models:**  Defining complex data structures for your visualizations.
* **Charting Libraries:** Integrating libraries like Chart.js, D3.js, or a commercial charting solution.
* **Authentication and Authorization:** Implementing secure user management (e.g., using Spring Security).
* **Database Choice:**  Selecting a production-ready database like PostgreSQL or MySQL instead of H2.
* **Error Handling:** Implementing comprehensive error handling and logging.
* **Scalability and Performance:** Designing for scalability and optimizing database queries.
* **Testing:** Writing comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
