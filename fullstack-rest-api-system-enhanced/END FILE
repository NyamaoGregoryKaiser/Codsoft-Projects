This is a drastically simplified example. A production-ready system would require significantly more code, including:

* **Error Handling:** Robust error handling throughout the application.
* **Authentication/Authorization:** Implementing secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT, OAuth).
* **Logging and Monitoring:**  Integration with logging frameworks (e.g., spdlog) and monitoring tools.
* **Caching:**  Implementation of caching strategies (e.g., Redis).
* **Rate Limiting:**  Preventing abuse by limiting the number of requests.
* **Testing Framework:**  Using a testing framework like GoogleTest or Catch2.
* **Deployment:**  A comprehensive deployment pipeline using Docker and a CI/CD system (e.g., GitLab CI, Jenkins, GitHub Actions).
* **HTTP Server:**  A fully-fledged HTTP server library.  cpprestsdk or Drogon are good choices.
* **Database:**  A robust database like PostgreSQL or MySQL (SQLite is suitable for very small projects only).


This expanded example provides a starting point. Remember to thoroughly research and implement the missing pieces to build a robust and secure API.  Each component mentioned above would require substantial code and careful design.
