This is a very rudimentary example.  A full implementation would require:

* **Frontend (React):**  Component structure for task listing, creation, editing, and user authentication.  State management (e.g., Redux, Context API).  Styling with CSS or a CSS framework.
* **Backend (Express.js):**  Complete implementation of CRUD operations for tasks and users, including proper error handling, input validation, and security measures.
* **Database (PostgreSQL):**  Migration scripts to set up the database schema.  Seed data for initial testing.
* **Authentication:**  Implementation of secure user registration, login, and token-based authentication.
* **Testing:**  Extensive unit, integration, and API tests using Jest, Supertest (or similar).
* **Deployment:** Dockerfile for containerization, and a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI).
* **Documentation:**  A comprehensive README, API documentation (e.g., Swagger), and architecture diagrams.


This expanded outline provides a more realistic starting point.  Remember to break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks to avoid being overwhelmed.  Utilizing a version control system (Git) is crucial throughout the development process.  This example only scratches the surface; building a production-ready system is a substantial undertaking.
