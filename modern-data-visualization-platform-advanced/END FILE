This is a highly simplified example.  A real-world project would require:

* **Frontend Framework:**  React, Vue, Angular, or similar for a rich user interface.
* **Backend Framework:**  Express.js (Node.js), Flask/Django (Python), or similar for API development.
* **Database:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, or another suitable database.  Consider database connection pooling for performance.
* **Authentication:** Implement robust authentication and authorization (e.g., JWT).
* **API Design:**  Design RESTful APIs for data retrieval and manipulation.
* **Charting Library:**  D3.js, Chart.js, or similar for visualization.
* **Testing Framework:** Jest, Mocha, pytest, or similar for unit and integration tests.
* **CI/CD:**  GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or similar for automated builds and deployments.
* **Docker Compose:** For managing multiple containers (database, API, frontend).


Remember to handle security best practices (input validation, sanitization, etc.) throughout the application.  This skeletal structure gives you a starting point.  Building a full-scale application requires significant effort and expertise in various technologies.  Breaking the project down into smaller, manageable tasks is crucial for success.
