This is a highly simplified example.  A real-world application would need:

* **Robust Error Handling:**  Proper exception handling, logging, and user-friendly error messages.
* **Data Persistence:** A real database (PostgreSQL, MySQL) instead of in-memory H2.
* **Authentication & Authorization:** Secure user accounts and access control.
* **Rate Limiting:** To avoid overloading target websites.
* **Caching:** To speed up repeated scrapes.
* **More Sophisticated Scraping Logic:**  Using CSS selectors or XPath to target specific elements.
* **Data Cleaning & Transformation:**  Processing scraped data to make it usable.
* **Proper Testing:** Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
* **Deployment:** Docker, Kubernetes, or other deployment strategies.
* **Frontend improvements:** A more user-friendly React app with features like progress indicators and result visualization.


This skeletal example provides a starting point.  Building a complete, production-ready system requires significantly more code and expertise in various technologies. Remember to always respect the `robots.txt` of the websites you scrape and adhere to their terms of service.  Unscrupulous scraping can lead to legal issues.
