This is just a tiny fraction of the code needed.  You would need to add:

* **PaymentService:**  Implementation for business logic (database interactions).
* **Database Schema:**  Design a robust database schema (consider using PostgreSQL for production).
* **Frontend:**  A React, Angular, or Vue.js application to interact with the API.
* **Security:**  Authentication (JWT, OAuth 2.0), authorization, input validation, and encryption.
* **Payment Gateway Integration:**  This is critical; you'll need to integrate with a reputable payment gateway like Stripe or PayPal.  This involves their APIs and security protocols.
* **Testing:**  Extensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
* **Deployment:**  Docker, Kubernetes, or other deployment strategies.
* **Monitoring & Logging:**  Implement robust logging and monitoring tools.

This expanded example highlights the complexity. Remember to prioritize security and follow best practices throughout the development process.  Building a secure and reliable payment system requires significant expertise and careful planning.  Consider using existing frameworks and libraries whenever possible to reduce development time and improve security.
