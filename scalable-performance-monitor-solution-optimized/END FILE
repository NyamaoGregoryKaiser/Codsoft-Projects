This is a highly simplified example. A production-ready system would require:

* **Frontend (React):**  Components for displaying metrics, charts, dashboards, etc.  This would involve fetching data from the backend API.
* **Authentication & Authorization:** Middleware to protect API endpoints and user data.  Consider using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
* **Error Handling:** Robust error handling middleware to gracefully handle exceptions.
* **Logging & Monitoring:** Integrate with a logging system (e.g., Winston, Bunyan) and monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
* **Caching:** Implement caching (e.g., Redis) to improve performance.
* **Rate Limiting:**  Protect against abuse with rate limiting middleware.
* **Testing:** Comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests using Jest or similar frameworks.  Consider using tools like Supertest for API testing.
* **Docker and CI/CD:** Configure Dockerfiles for building and deploying the application, and set up a CI/CD pipeline using tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins.
* **Database Migrations:** Use Prisma Migrate or similar tools for managing database schema changes.
* **Deployment:**  Choose a deployment platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud) and configure deployment scripts.


Remember to replace placeholder values with your actual environment variables and configurations. This skeletal example provides a starting point for building a more comprehensive performance monitoring system.  The actual implementation would be significantly larger and more complex.
