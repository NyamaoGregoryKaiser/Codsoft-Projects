This is a very basic example.  A full-fledged system would require:

* **Detailed Frontend:**  A React, Vue, or Angular frontend for visualizing metrics, dashboards, and alerts.
* **Robust Authentication:**  Implementation using JWT or OAuth.
* **Comprehensive Error Handling:**  Detailed logging and error reporting.
* **Advanced Database Interactions:**  Efficient queries, potentially using database views and stored procedures.
* **Extensive Testing:**  Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests covering all aspects of the application.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:**  Using tools like GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, or Jenkins.
* **Docker Configuration:**  Dockerfile for building and running the application in containers.
* **Monitoring Tools:**  Integration with tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog.

Remember to replace placeholder comments with actual implementation details.  This expanded structure should provide a more complete and helpful starting point.  This is a complex project requiring substantial effort to fully realize.
