This is a highly simplified example. A production-ready system would require:

* **Robust error handling:**  Handle exceptions gracefully and return meaningful error messages.
* **Security best practices:** Use strong password hashing, protect against common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF), and implement proper input validation.
* **Detailed logging:** Log all relevant events for debugging and auditing.
* **Comprehensive testing:** Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests are crucial.  Aim for high test coverage.
* **Deployment strategy:**  Consider using Docker and Kubernetes for easier deployment and scalability.
* **Frontend implementation (React):**  Build a React app to handle user interaction, including secure communication with the backend API using JWT.
* **Database Migrations:**  Use tools like Flyway or Liquibase to manage database schema changes.
* **Caching:**  Implement caching for frequently accessed data.
* **Rate Limiting:**  Protect your API from brute-force attacks.
* **Authorization:** Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to resources based on user roles.


Remember to replace placeholder comments with actual implementation details and adapt the code to your specific requirements and technologies. This outline provides a strong foundation for building a more complete and robust authentication system.  You'll need significant further development to reach a 2000+ line codebase with the features described.
