This is a very basic outline. A production-ready system would require extensive additions:

* **Detailed frontend:**  A fully functional React (or other framework) application with proper routing, state management (Redux, Context API, etc.), robust UI/UX, and error handling.
* **Comprehensive backend:**  Complete implementation of all CRUD operations, error handling middleware, authentication (JWT, OAuth), authorization, rate limiting, caching (Redis, Memcached), and logging (e.g., using structured logging libraries).
* **Security:**  Input validation, output encoding, protection against SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other vulnerabilities.
* **Testing:**  Thorough unit, integration, and end-to-end tests with high coverage.  Performance testing using tools like k6 or Locust.
* **CI/CD:**  Setup of a CI/CD pipeline using tools like GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, or Jenkins.
* **Deployment:**  Deployment to a cloud provider (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) or a container orchestration platform (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm).
* **Documentation:**  Extensive documentation covering all aspects of the system.


Remember to replace placeholder values like `your_secret_key` with actual, securely generated values. This is a starting point; building a full-scale, secure application requires significant effort and expertise.  Consider using a more comprehensive framework like Django (Python) or Node.js with Express.js for a more streamlined development process for a larger project.
