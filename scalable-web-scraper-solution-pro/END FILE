This is a highly simplified example.  A production-ready system would require:

* **Robust Error Handling:**  Handle network errors, invalid URLs, malformed HTML, and exceptions during data processing.
* **Rate Limiting:** Implement mechanisms to avoid overloading target websites.
* **Caching:** Cache scraped data to reduce load on the target websites and improve performance.
* **Database Integration:**  Properly integrate with a database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) for persistent storage.  Include migrations and robust schema design.
* **Authentication and Authorization:** Secure the API to prevent unauthorized access.
* **Comprehensive Testing:**  Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests are crucial.
* **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement logging for debugging and monitoring system health.
* **Advanced Scraping Techniques:** Use more sophisticated techniques like CSS selectors, XPath expressions for targeted data extraction.  Handle JavaScript rendering (e.g., using Selenium or Playwright).
* **Frontend:** Build a user interface (React, Angular, Vue, etc.) for interacting with the API.

This expanded system would easily exceed 2000 lines of code. Remember to consider ethical implications and respect `robots.txt` when building your web scraper.  Always obtain permission from website owners before scraping their data.
