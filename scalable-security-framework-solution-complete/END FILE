This is a highly simplified example.  A real-world project would require:

* **Detailed database design:**  Consider normalization, indexing, and relationships.
* **Robust API design:** Use a well-defined API framework (e.g., RESTful principles).
* **Comprehensive authentication and authorization:** Implement secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT, OAuth 2.0) and role-based access control (RBAC).
* **Extensive testing:** Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests are critical.  Consider mocking external dependencies for unit testing.
* **Deployment strategy:**  Plan for deployment to a cloud platform (AWS, Azure, GCP) or on-premise server.
* **Frontend development:**  A full-stack application requires a frontend (React, Angular, Vue.js, etc.).
* **Error handling and logging:** Implement robust error handling and logging throughout the application.
* **Security best practices:**  Follow secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).

This skeletal structure provides a starting point for building a much more complex system.  Building a full-fledged, secure web application requires significant development effort and expertise.
