This is a highly simplified example. A full-scale project would require:

* **Robust error handling:**  More sophisticated error handling for network issues, invalid URLs, and parsing errors.
* **Database interaction:**  A fully implemented database schema (using Postgres, MySQL, or MongoDB), migrations, and seed data.  This would involve storing scraped data, user accounts, and settings.
* **Authentication and authorization:** Middleware to secure API endpoints using JWTs or other authentication mechanisms.
* **Rate limiting:** Prevent overloading target websites with requests.  Implement a mechanism to control the number of requests per IP address or time period.
* **Caching:** Use a caching layer (like Redis) to reduce the number of requests and improve performance.
* **Logging and monitoring:**  Integrate logging (e.g., Winston, Bunyan) and monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track application health and performance.
* **Comprehensive testing:**  Write unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure code quality.  Aim for high test coverage.
* **CI/CD pipeline:** Automate the build, testing, and deployment process using tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins.
* **Frontend:** A React, Vue, or Angular frontend to interact with the API and display scraped data to the user.


Remember to replace placeholder comments and adapt the code to your specific scraping needs and data model.  This skeletal structure provides a starting point for building a more comprehensive application.  Building a complete system of this scale is a substantial undertaking.
