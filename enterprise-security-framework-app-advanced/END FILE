**(This is a drastically simplified example. A real-world application would require much more robust error handling, authentication, authorization, input validation, etc.  You would need to implement a complete set of API endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for your tasks and users.)**

To complete this project, you would need to:

* **Implement Authentication:**  Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or another secure method.
* **Create User Model and Routes:** Handle user registration, login, and profile management.
* **Write Thorough Tests:** Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests are crucial.
* **Set up Docker:** Create a `Dockerfile` to containerize your application.
* **Configure CI/CD:** Use a service like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins.
* **Implement Caching:** Use Redis or Memcached to cache frequently accessed data.
* **Implement Rate Limiting:** Prevent abuse of your API.
* **Add Frontend:**  Develop a React, Angular, or Vue.js frontend to interact with the API.
* **Improve the UI/UX:** Design a user-friendly and intuitive interface.


This detailed outline gives you a strong starting point. Remember to break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks and to focus on writing clean, well-documented code.  The complete project would require significantly more code and effort.
