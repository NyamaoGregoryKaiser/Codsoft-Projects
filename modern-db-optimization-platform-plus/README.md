# Database Optimization System

This project provides a basic framework for a database optimization system.  It's designed to be expanded upon for real-world applications.

## Setup

1.  Install dependencies: `npm install` (for frontend, if added) and follow instructions for C++ dependencies (see `package.json` or `requirements.txt` â€“ these will be significantly more extensive in a real implementation).
2.  Set up the PostgreSQL database (see `db/schema.sql`).
3.  Run database migrations (add migration script examples).
4.  Start the server: (Instructions for running the C++ server).
5.  (Frontend setup instructions if applicable).
