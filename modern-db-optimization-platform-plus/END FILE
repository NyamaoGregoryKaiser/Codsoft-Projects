This is a very rudimentary example.  A real-world application would need:

*   **Extensive error handling:** Robust mechanisms to handle database errors, network issues, and application exceptions.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** Secure user authentication (e.g., using JWT) and role-based access control.
*   **Caching:** Implement caching strategies (e.g., Redis) to reduce database load.
*   **Rate limiting:** Prevent abuse of the API.
*   **Logging and monitoring:** Track application performance and identify issues.
*   **Comprehensive testing:** Unit, integration, API, and performance tests to ensure quality and stability.
*   **Deployment pipelines:** Automated deployment using Docker and CI/CD tools.

Remember to replace placeholder values like database credentials with your actual configuration.  This skeletal structure requires significant expansion to become a fully functional, production-ready system.  You would need to use a build system (like CMake) to manage dependencies, compile, and link your C++ code.  The frontend would need to be developed separately and integrated.  Thorough testing is absolutely crucial.
