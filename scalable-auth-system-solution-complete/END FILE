This is a highly simplified example.  A production-ready system would require:

* **Robust error handling:**  Properly handling exceptions and returning informative error messages.
* **Input validation:** Sanitizing and validating user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities.
* **JWT authentication:**  Implementing JSON Web Tokens for secure session management.
* **Authorization:**  Controlling access to resources based on user roles and permissions.
* **Database migrations:** Using a tool like Alembic to manage database schema changes.
* **Testing:**  Writing comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
* **Deployment:**  Setting up a production-ready deployment pipeline using Docker and a CI/CD system.
* **Security best practices:**  Following secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).


This expanded outline provides a more realistic starting point for building a complete authentication system. Remember to break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks and iterate on your development.  This will ensure a more maintainable and scalable application.
