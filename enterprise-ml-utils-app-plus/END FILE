This is a highly simplified example.  A production-ready system would require:

* **Robust error handling:**  More comprehensive exception handling and logging.
* **Authentication and Authorization:**  Integration with an authentication system (e.g., JWT).
* **Database Migrations:**  Using Alembic or similar for database schema management.
* **Model Persistence:**  Saving and loading the trained machine learning model (using pickle, joblib, or a model registry).
* **Comprehensive Testing:**  Extensive unit, integration, and API tests with high code coverage.
* **Deployment:**  Using Docker Compose for easier deployment and orchestration.  Adding a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI).
* **Caching:** Implementing a caching layer (e.g., Redis) to improve performance.
* **Rate Limiting:** Protecting against abuse.
* **Frontend:** A frontend (using React, Vue, or similar) would be needed for user interaction.


Remember to replace placeholder values (database credentials, etc.) with your actual configuration.  This expanded structure provides a more realistic foundation for building your comprehensive machine learning application.  You will need to significantly expand on this to reach 2000+ lines of code.
