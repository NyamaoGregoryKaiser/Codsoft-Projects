This is a VERY rudimentary example.  A real-world CMS would need:

* **Frontend:**  A robust frontend using a framework like React, Vue, or Angular.  This would involve significant JavaScript, HTML, and CSS code.
* **Backend Framework:** A C++ framework like Drogon or similar to handle requests, routing, and middleware.
* **Database:** A robust database like PostgreSQL or MySQL, with proper schema design, migrations, and optimized queries.
* **Authentication/Authorization:**  Implementation of secure authentication (e.g., JWT) and role-based authorization.
* **Testing Framework:**  A framework like Google Test or Catch2 for unit and integration tests.  Extensive testing is crucial.
* **Deployment:**  Configuration for a cloud platform (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) or a dedicated server.  CI/CD pipeline using tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI.


Remember to replace placeholder comments with actual implementations.  Building a complete CMS is a substantial project; break it down into smaller, manageable tasks.  This example provides a starting point, but significant further development is required.
