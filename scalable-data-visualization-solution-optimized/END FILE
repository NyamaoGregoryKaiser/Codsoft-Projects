This is a highly simplified example.  A production-ready application would require:

* **Frontend:** A React, Vue, or Angular application to handle user interaction and display visualizations using libraries like Chart.js, D3.js, or Recharts.
* **Authentication:**  Implementation of user authentication and authorization (e.g., using JWTs).
* **Robust Error Handling:**  Comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the application.
* **Data Processing:** More sophisticated data processing and aggregation to handle large datasets.
* **Database:**  A properly configured and optimized database with indexes and potentially database connection pooling.
* **Testing:**  Extensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
* **Deployment:**  A proper deployment pipeline using Docker, Kubernetes, or other containerization and orchestration technologies.
* **Security:**  Implementation of security best practices to prevent vulnerabilities.


This skeletal structure provides a starting point. You'll need to fill in the substantial gaps to achieve a production-ready system. Remember to consult relevant documentation for each technology used (Express.js, Prisma, your chosen frontend framework, charting libraries, etc.)  This task is far beyond the scope of a single code response.
