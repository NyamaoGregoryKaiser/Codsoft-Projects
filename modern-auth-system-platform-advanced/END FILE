This is a highly simplified example.  A production-ready system would need:

* **Robust Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling for all API endpoints and database interactions.
* **Input Validation:**  Strict input validation to prevent vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
* **Security Best Practices:** Secure password storage (using bcrypt or Argon2), protection against common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).
* **Scalability:** Design for scalability, considering load balancing and database optimization.
* **Chosen Web Framework:** A full-fledged web framework (like Express.js, Flask, or a C++ framework) for handling routing, requests, and responses.  The C++ examples above are stubs.
* **Database Choice:** A suitable database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB) with proper connection pooling and transaction management.
* **Testing Framework:**  A robust testing framework with unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

Remember to consult security best practices and follow the recommendations of your chosen framework and database. This skeletal structure provides a starting point; a complete implementation would be significantly more extensive.  This example omits the frontend (UI) completely,  which would require a separate framework (React, Vue, Angular, etc.) and substantial additional code.
