This is a very basic example. A full implementation would require:

* **Frontend (React):**  Components to display charts and graphs of performance data, fetching data from the backend API.
* **Authentication/Authorization:** Implement JWT-based authentication with user roles and permissions.
* **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling middleware to catch and log errors gracefully.
* **Logging and Monitoring:** Integrate with a logging system (e.g., Winston, Bunyan) and monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
* **Caching:** Implement a caching layer (e.g., Redis) to improve response times.
* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
* **Comprehensive Testing:** Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests are crucial for a production-ready system.  Jest and a testing framework like React Testing Library would be used.
* **Dockerfile:** Create a `Dockerfile` to containerize the application.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** Setup a CI/CD pipeline using tools like GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, or Jenkins to automate building, testing, and deploying the application.
* **Deployment:** Deploy the application to a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) or a hosting platform like Heroku.


This expanded structure provides a starting point for a much more complete application. Remember to break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks.  Focus on getting a minimal viable product (MVP) working first, then iteratively add features and improve performance.  Remember to consult the documentation for each library and framework you use.
