This is a highly simplified example. A production system would require:

* **Robust Error Handling:**  Proper exception handling throughout the application.
* **Authentication & Authorization:**  Secure API access using JWTs, OAuth, or other methods.
* **Comprehensive Testing:**  Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests are crucial.
* **Database Migrations:**  A system for managing schema changes.
* **Logging and Monitoring:**  Use a logging framework (e.g., spdlog) and monitoring tools.
* **Caching:**  Implement caching to improve performance for frequently accessed data.
* **Configuration Management:**  Use a configuration file to manage settings.


Remember to choose and install your preferred C++ framework (e.g., Drogon, Pistache, Crow), database library (e.g., libpqxx for PostgreSQL), and testing framework (e.g., Catch2, Google Test).  This significantly expands the codebase beyond what can be provided in this response.  Building a full-scale, enterprise-grade application requires a substantial development effort.
