This is a highly simplified example. A production-ready system would require:

* **Secure Password Handling:**  Use strong hashing algorithms (like bcrypt or Argon2) with salting to protect passwords.  Never store passwords in plain text.
* **Database Integration:** Replace the `users` map with a proper database connection (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) using a database library.  Implement proper database transactions and error handling.
* **API Framework:** Use a C++ web framework (e.g., Drogon, Pistache) to create robust and scalable APIs.
* **Authorization:** Implement role-based access control (RBAC) or another authorization mechanism to restrict access to resources based on user roles.
* **Session Management:** Use secure session management techniques to track authenticated users.  Consider using JWTs (JSON Web Tokens).
* **Input Validation:**  Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
* **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling and logging to catch and report issues.
* **Testing:**  Write extensive unit, integration, and API tests to ensure the system's correctness and reliability.


Remember that security is paramount.  This skeletal example is for illustrative purposes only and should **not** be used in a production environment without significant enhancements to address security vulnerabilities.  You should research and implement industry best practices for authentication and authorization.  Consider exploring dedicated authentication libraries and frameworks to simplify development and improve security.
