This is a vastly simplified example.  A production-ready application would require:

* **Frontend:** A complete frontend using a framework like React, Vue, or Angular to interact with the API and display the visualizations (using libraries like Chart.js, D3.js, or similar).
* **Robust Authentication:**  Implementation of a secure authentication system (e.g., using JWTs and a suitable strategy like OAuth 2.0).
* **Comprehensive Testing:**  Extensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests are crucial.
* **Error Handling:**  Graceful handling of errors throughout the application, including database errors and API request failures.
* **Caching:** Implementing a caching layer (like Redis) to improve performance.
* **Deployment:** Setting up a proper CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, or Jenkins) for automated builds and deployments.
* **Database Migrations:** A robust system for managing database schema changes.
* **Seed Data:**  Provisioning of realistic seed data for testing and initial setup.
* **Logging and Monitoring:**  Proper logging and monitoring to track application health and performance.

Remember to replace placeholder database credentials and adjust paths as needed.  This expanded outline provides a more realistic starting point for your project.  Remember to break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks.
