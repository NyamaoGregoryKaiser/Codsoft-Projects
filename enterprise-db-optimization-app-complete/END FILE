This is a very basic example.  A production-ready system would require significantly more code to handle authentication, authorization, error handling, logging, caching, query optimization strategies (indexing, query rewriting),  robust testing (unit, integration, performance, API),  CI/CD pipelines (using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions), Docker setup, and comprehensive documentation.  The frontend would need to be developed separately.  Remember to consult the documentation for Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and PostgreSQL for detailed instructions and best practices.  This example provides a starting point for building your full-scale database optimization system.
