This is a vastly simplified example.  A production-ready system would need:

* **Detailed database schema:**  With proper data types, indexes, foreign keys, etc.  Consider using a migration tool (like Alembic for PostgreSQL or similar tools for other databases) to manage schema changes.
* **Robust authentication:**  Implement secure password hashing, JWT handling, potentially OAuth2 integration.
* **Comprehensive error handling:**  Handle various error types gracefully, providing informative responses to clients.
* **Input validation:**  Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.).
* **Comprehensive testing:**  Unit tests for individual functions, integration tests to test interactions between components, and end-to-end tests to simulate real user scenarios.  Achieving 80% test coverage requires significant effort.
* **Deployment strategies:**  Consider using Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, and a CI/CD pipeline for automated builds and deployments.
* **Logging and monitoring:**  Implement comprehensive logging to track application behavior and use monitoring tools to track performance and identify issues.
* **Caching:**  Implement caching mechanisms (like Redis) to improve performance.

Remember to replace placeholder comments with actual implementations and adjust the code to match your specific requirements.  This expanded structure provides a more realistic starting point for a larger project.  Building a complete system from this requires significant coding and testing.
