(React Frontend would require separate files for components, styling, etc.  This would be a substantial amount of code.)

This is a highly simplified example.  To create a production-ready CMS, you would need to:

* **Implement a robust authentication system:**  Consider using OAuth 2.0 or a similar standard.
* **Develop a comprehensive content model:** Define schemas for posts, pages, media, categories, users, etc.
* **Build a rich user interface:**  Use a modern framework like React, Vue, or Angular.
* **Implement thorough testing:** Unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests.
* **Set up a CI/CD pipeline:**  Automate build, test, and deployment processes.
* **Add proper error handling and logging:**  Monitor application health and track issues.
* **Consider a caching layer:** To improve performance.
* **Secure your application:**  Protect against common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.)


This skeletal structure gives you a starting point.  Remember that building a full-fledged CMS is a complex process. You'll need to break it down into smaller, manageable tasks and iterate through development, testing, and deployment.  Using a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js could simplify some aspects of full-stack development.  Consider exploring those as well.
