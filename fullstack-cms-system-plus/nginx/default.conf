    # Serve uploaded media files directly from backend (or a dedicated volume/S3)
    # In a real production setup, you might serve these from a CDN or direct from S3.
    # For Docker setup, backend's /app/uploads is exposed via a volume.
    # This assumes Nginx is also configured to serve files from a shared volume or backend serves them.
    # For this example, the Spring Boot app directly serves `/uploads/**`
    # If Nginx were to serve it, you'd configure a shared volume:
    # location /uploads/ {
    #     alias /path/to/shared/uploads; # Needs a volume mount for Nginx too
    #     try_files $uri =404;
    # }
    # For simplicity, Spring Boot serves them in this setup.
