This is a VERY basic example.  A production-ready CMS would require:

* **Frontend:**  A React, Vue, or Angular application to handle the user interface.
* **Authentication:**  Robust user authentication and authorization system (likely using JWTs).
* **Database Schema:**  A well-designed database schema with tables for users, posts, comments, categories, etc.
* **Extensive Testing:**  Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all components and APIs.
* **Deployment:**  Configuration for a cloud provider (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) or on-premises server.
* **Error Handling:**  Comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the application.
* **Security:**  Implementation of security best practices to prevent vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).
* **Rich Text Editor:**  Integration of a WYSIWYG editor for content creation.


Remember to replace placeholder values like database credentials with your actual configuration.  This skeletal structure provides a starting point; building a full-scale CMS requires substantial further development.  Consider using a framework like Next.js (React), Nuxt.js (Vue), or similar to streamline the development process.
