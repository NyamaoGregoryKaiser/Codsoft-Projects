This is a drastically simplified example.  A real-world payment system would need:

* **Secure Payment Gateway Integration:**  Integration with a reputable payment gateway (Stripe, PayPal, Braintree, etc.) is crucial.  This involves handling sensitive data securely according to PCI DSS standards.
* **Robust Error Handling:**  Graceful handling of errors, including network issues, gateway failures, and invalid transactions.
* **Transaction Management:**  Ensuring data consistency through database transactions.
* **Comprehensive Security:**  Implementing measures like input validation, authentication, authorization, and encryption throughout the application.
* **Scalability and Performance:**  Designing the system to handle a large volume of transactions efficiently.
* **Monitoring and Logging:**  Tracking system health, transaction success/failure rates, and identifying potential issues.


This skeletal structure provides a starting point.  Building a complete payment processing system requires a much larger codebase,  significant expertise in secure coding practices, and careful consideration of regulatory compliance. Remember to prioritize security above all else.  Consult with security professionals and utilize established security best practices throughout the development process.
