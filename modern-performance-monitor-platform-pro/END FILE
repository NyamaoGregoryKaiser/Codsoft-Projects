This is a highly simplified example. A real-world system would require significantly more code to handle error handling, robust database interactions, authentication, authorization, logging, caching,  extensive testing, and a production-ready frontend.  Remember to replace placeholder comments with actual implementation details based on your chosen technologies.  Consider using a more mature C++ web framework for a production environment.  This example aims to provide a skeletal structure to guide you in building a more complete system.
