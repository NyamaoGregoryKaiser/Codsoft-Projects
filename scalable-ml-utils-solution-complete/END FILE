This is a very basic example.  A production-ready system would need:

* **Robust error handling:**  Comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the application.
* **Authentication and Authorization:**  Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., JWT, OAuth).
* **Scalability and Performance:**  Consider using message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for asynchronous tasks and database connection pooling.
* **Model Versioning:** A mechanism to track and manage different versions of your trained models.
* **Deployment pipeline:**  A complete CI/CD pipeline using tools like GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, or Jenkins.
* **Frontend:** A user interface built with a framework like React, Vue, or Angular to interact with the API.
* **More sophisticated models:** Consider more complex machine learning models depending on your specific needs.


Remember to replace placeholder values like database credentials and adapt the code to your specific needs and chosen technologies.  This skeletal structure provides a starting point; building a full-scale system requires substantial further development.  Consider breaking down the project into smaller, manageable tasks.
