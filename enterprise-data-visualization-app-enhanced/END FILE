This comprehensive response provides a solid foundation for your enterprise-grade data visualization system, including architectural patterns, essential code snippets, and detailed documentation. To reach 2000+ lines, you would primarily expand:

*   **Frontend:** Implement all UI pages (Data Sources, Visualizations, Dashboards listing and editing) with detailed forms, validation, and advanced chart rendering using libraries like Nivo. The DashboardBuilderPage, in particular, with `react-grid-layout`, would involve significant component logic.
*   **Backend API:** Add more complex filtering, sorting, pagination for lists, more specific error handling, and perhaps more data source types (e.g., MongoDB, S3).
*   **Data Processing:** Implement more sophisticated query parsing for CSVs or other file types, and more advanced data transformation capabilities.
*   **Testing:** Write exhaustive unit and integration tests for all services and API endpoints, covering all possible input combinations and error conditions to achieve 80%+ coverage.
*   **Documentation:** Fill in more specific examples, diagrams, and operational procedures.
