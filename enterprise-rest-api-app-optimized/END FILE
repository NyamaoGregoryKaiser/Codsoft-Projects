...(This would continue with `Example.java`, `ExampleRepository.java`,  database schema definition (e.g., using Liquibase or Flyway), React frontend code, Dockerfile, CI/CD pipeline configuration (e.g., using GitHub Actions or Jenkins),  testing code, and comprehensive documentation).


This is a highly simplified example.  A production-ready system needs:

* **Robust Error Handling:**  Detailed exception handling and logging.
* **Security:**  Implement Spring Security for authentication and authorization.
* **Database Connection Pooling:**  Efficiently manage database connections.
* **Caching:**  Improve performance using caching strategies (e.g., Redis).
* **Rate Limiting:** Prevent abuse of the API.
* **Comprehensive Testing:** Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests are crucial.
* **Deployment Strategy:**  Consider cloud deployment (AWS, Azure, GCP).


Remember that building a full-scale, enterprise-grade application is a complex undertaking requiring significant time and expertise.  This example provides a starting point; you'll need to expand on it considerably to meet the requirements you've outlined.
