This is a highly simplified example.  A production-ready CMS needs:

* **Robust Authentication & Authorization:**  Likely using JWTs or OAuth.
* **Comprehensive Frontend:**  A React, Vue, or Angular application with a rich UI.
* **Data Validation:**  To prevent malformed data from reaching the database.
* **Error Handling:**  Thorough error handling and logging throughout the application.
* **Security Measures:**  Protection against common web vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.).
* **Testing:**  Extensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
* **Deployment:**  A well-defined deployment process (e.g., using Docker and Kubernetes).


This skeletal structure provides a starting point.  Building a full-fledged CMS is a substantial project requiring a team and a considerable amount of time.  Remember to break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks.  Consider using a more structured approach like a MVC or microservices architecture for larger projects.
