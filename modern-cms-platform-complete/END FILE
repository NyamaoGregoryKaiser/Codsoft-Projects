This is a highly simplified example.  A production-ready CMS would require:

* **Detailed authentication and authorization:**  Implementing robust user roles, permissions, and secure password handling.
* **Comprehensive data models:**  Designing schemas for posts, users, categories, media, etc.
* **Frontend development (React):**  Building the user interface for content creation, editing, and display.
* **Extensive testing:**  Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all components.
* **Deployment pipeline:**  Setting up CI/CD using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, or similar.
* **Error handling and logging:**  Implementing robust error handling and logging for debugging and monitoring.
* **Caching:** Implementing a caching layer (e.g., Redis) to improve performance.
* **Rich text editor integration:** Integrate a WYSIWYG editor for content creation.


This skeletal structure gives you a starting point. You must expand upon it substantially to achieve a production-ready CMS.  Remember to consult relevant documentation for Express.js, React, PostgreSQL, and your chosen testing and CI/CD tools.  Consider using a framework like Next.js or Remix for the frontend to streamline development.  For larger projects, explore using an ORM like Sequelize or TypeORM to simplify database interactions.
