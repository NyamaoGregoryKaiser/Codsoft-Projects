This is a highly simplified example.  A production-ready CMS would require:

* **User Authentication and Authorization:**  Implement user roles, permissions, and secure authentication (e.g., using JWTs).
* **Robust Frontend:** Use a framework like React, Vue, or Angular for a complex, user-friendly interface.
* **Extensive Testing:**  Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests are crucial.
* **Deployment Infrastructure:**  Configure a production-ready deployment pipeline (e.g., using Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD tools).
* **Error Handling and Logging:** Implement comprehensive error handling and logging for debugging and monitoring.
* **Data Validation:** Validate all user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities.
* **Caching:** Implement caching to improve performance.
* **Security:** Protect against common web vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

This response provides a starting point. Building a full-fledged CMS is a substantial undertaking.  Consider using existing CMS frameworks or platforms to accelerate development if you don't need highly customized functionality.
